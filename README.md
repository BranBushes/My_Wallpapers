# My_Wallpapers
Pretty Wallpapers I collected to use on my desktop

**Installation:**
1. Clone this repository by using the command- 
   >git clone https://github.com/BranBushes/My_Wallpapers.git
2. Create a user background directory if not created already- 
   >mkdir ~/.local/share/backgrounds
3. Cd to all the backgrounds directories and delete everything that's there by default-
   >cd /usr/share/backgrounds/
   
   >sudo rm -r *
   
   >cd ~/.local/share/backgrounds
   
   >sudo rm -r *
4. Cd to cloned directory and Move all of it's contents to the user backgrounds directory-
   >cd ~/My_Wallpapers
   
   >mv * ~/.local/share/backgrounds

Hope this makes getting my wallpapers easier.
